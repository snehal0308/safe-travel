Paris,1450,"The City of Light draws millions of visitors every year with its unforgettable ambiance. Of course, the divine cuisine and vast art collections deserve some of the credit as well. The gentle River Seine rambles through the city, flanked by stately museums, centuries-old churches, and blocks of Rococo- and Neoclassic-design architecture, further enhanced by cascading trees and glowing streetlamps. Peppering the Seine's cobbled walks and graceful bridges are impossibly chic Parisians, probably on their way to the market, cafe or cinema.

Containing world-class museums, fashion, cuisine and an atmosphere all its own, Paris is also a city of ""many splendors,"" as Ernest Hemingway recalled in his memoir, ""A Moveable Feast."" Visit the beloved MusÇe d'Orsay, shop the biggest designers on the Champs êlysÇes or hit the boutiques in Le Marais, take in the view atop the Eiffel Tower, or even plan a day trip to Versailles Palace. But don't miss out on the simple pleasure of meandering the marvelous arrondissements (districts), or snacking on street crepes either.",https://travel.usnews.com/Paris_France/
Bora Bora,3184,"The small island of Bora Bora (just about 6 miles long and a little more than 2 miles wide) overflows with beauty. A dormant volcano rises up at its center and fans out into lush jungle before spilling into an aquamarine lagoon. In fact, author James Michener, who wrote ""Tales of the South Pacific,"" called Bora Bora ""the most beautiful island in the world."" The 18th-century British explorer James Cook even coined it as the ""Pearl of the Pacific."" The very definition of a tropical getaway, blissful Bora Bora abounds with luxurious resorts, sunny skies, warm waters and friendly locals. 

And as you might've already guessed, the main industry on this petite island in French Polynesia and its swarm of tiny motu (islands) is tourism. To that end, you can snorkel, explore Vaitape (Bora Bora's main port), hike Mount Otemanu and more. But there's a catch: Bora Bora is expensive ? very expensive. In short, visit Bora Bora for natural beauty, visit for utter relaxation and visit if you have the money.",https://travel.usnews.com/Bora_Bora/
Maui,2515,"Maui is not nearly as large as the Big Island, nor is it as small as Lanai, as bustling as Oahu or as quiet as Kauai. For many Hawaii vacationers, Maui is just right ? offering a taste of just about everything the Aloha State has to offer, from impressive wildlife to intriguing history and culture. While on a visit here, you can shimmy alongside professional hula dancers, golf along coastal fairways, sail down a zip line, snorkel alongside five different types of sea turtles or simply lounge along some of Hawaii's most notable beaches.

One of the archipelago's most popular tourism spots, Maui can be found sandwiched between the Big Island and the much tinier Molokai (which you can explore by signing up for one of the best Maui tours). Maui is divided into five distinct regions: Many travelers base themselves along the coasts of South Maui (home to the famous Wailea Beach) or West Maui, where the sands of Kaanapali Beach and the music from the Old Lahaina Luau are located. But the rest of the island should not be missed. Travel along the Road to Hana to experience East Maui's scenic coastline, explore Haleakala ? the world's largest dormant volcano ? in the Upcountry and discover the former tribal battlegrounds of Central Maui's Iao Valley State Park. And for a bird's-eye view of it all, reserve a spot on one of Maui's best helicopter tours.",https://travel.usnews.com/Maui_HI/
Tahiti,1932,"Miles of shoreline, dozens of resorts, French cuisine to die for ? Tahiti has all the makings of a honeymoon destination. But beach bums often pass over Tahiti's sands in favor of Bora Bora's ivory shores. Despite its idyllic reputation and accessibility, Tahiti is more of an off-the-beaten-path stop than a romantic getaway. However, that doesn't mean Tahiti should be ignored.

Leafy forests sit beside sandy shores, French cràpes are served alongside Tahitian poisson cru (raw fish). If there ever was a place that embodies the beautiful duality of the French Polynesian archipelago, it's Tahiti. Here, the quirky, often chaotic atmosphere of the island's capital, Papeete, rubs elbows with uncorrupted natural beauty. In fact, Tahiti ? the largest of French Polynesia's 118 islands ? is often referred to as two separate islands despite them being joined by a tiny land bridge. Tahiti Nui is the larger, northern section where Papeete can be found. Tahiti Iti (the smaller half) is less accessible, although many visitors make the trek here for a taste of seclusion. Just note that spending a week on either part of Tahiti will cost you quite a chunk of change. But travelers agree that the warm waters, the lush jungles and the luxurious resorts are worth the splurge.",https://travel.usnews.com/Tahiti_French_Polynesia/
London,1362,"Life in London is nothing short of invigorating, and travelers find that one visit isn't enough to experience everything this two-millennia-old city has to offer.

Here, the antiquated clasps hands with the contemporary. You'll find the historic Tower of London and the avant-garde Tate Modern. You can catch both the Bard's works and modern plays at Shakespeare's Globe and its accompanying Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. And while Londoners still praise the power of tea, they now make room for Starbucks and Costa Coffees here and there, and pressed juice too. A current leader in everything from politics and banking to fashion and music, London's culture compass is always attuned to what's next. Discover it all on one of London's best tours.",https://travel.usnews.com/London_England/
Rome,1121,"Rome, the city of seven hills, enjoyed a mythic beginning. Romulus and Remus ? twin brothers who were nursed by a she-wolf and fathered by a war god ? reportedly founded the Eternal City. And although historians are a little skeptical about this epic entry into the world, most travelers are absolutely certain that there is something magical about Rome. Whether it's the mystery of nearby Vatican City or the ghosts of the Colosseum, an afternoon caffä on Piazza Navona or a piled-high plate of pasta at a trattoria, Roma is sure to enchant.

Italy's capital city, Rome is also known for a history that dates back to the eras of Octavian, Julius Caesar and Hadrian, among others. Left behind are structures like the Pantheon, the Roman Forum and dozens of churches, among other historic gems. Art enthusiasts will relish the trove of art housed at the Vatican Museums, and foodies will enjoy the splendid Italian fare, not to mention the gelato. And though its momentous past is the focus for many vacationers, Rome is also a fast-paced, modern and relevant city, with gleaming designer storefronts, sleek hotels and cutting-edge restaurants.",https://travel.usnews.com/Rome_Italy/
Phuket,631,"Pure white sands, aquamarine waters and limestone cliffs await travelers who visit Thailand's southwestern island of Phuket. Surrounded by the Andaman Sea and about an hour by plane from Bangkok, this island is a little piece of paradise, which comes with a relatively low price tag for everything from its accommodations to spa treatments and boat tours. But along with its tropical appeal, Phuket beckons to travelers wanting to experience its flavorful cuisine (think: lemongrass, lime leaves, chillies) and its rich culture, heavily influenced by its reigning religion: Buddhism. 

And although the island's beaches and tourism operators have bounced back from the 2004 tsunami, which hammered its western coast and tragically claimed thousands of lives, it remembers the past with memorials and a better warning system, should the area once again come under threat.

Tokyo,1858,"""Animated"" is perhaps the best word to describe Tokyo. Crazy about its anime, Japan's mega city is constantly buzzing with movement ? feet clacking down sidewalks, cars zooming along streets, subway trains humming below ground, ships cruising in and out. And yet bright lights and loud signs beg you to pause, to break your motion for just one second to pray (oops, we mean pay) at the altar of consumerism. This is a city that feeds on motion and progress.

But when you want to stop in Tokyo, the city will certainly make it worth your while. The tech-savvy locals may whizz past the monuments and urban parks daily (except during the cherry blossom season when everyone floods the green space), but, we assure you, the museums and historical sites are world-class. Here, there are photos to be taken, sushi to be eaten and a lot of shopping to be done. So what are you waiting for? You better get a move on.",https://travel.usnews.com/Tokyo_Japan/
Barcelona,968,"Barcelona contains both the authentically historic and the wildly bizarre. From the scenic trails of the colorful Park GÅell to the romantic narrow alleys of Barri Gïtic; from the beachside nightclubs to the city's dozens of sacred churches and architectural marvels, this city by the sea seems to attract all types: the adventurer, the couple, the partier, the culture lover ? and more ? with an almost overwhelming variety of things to do. You could stay for a few days, but chances are you'll need a whole week to explore.

In Barcelona, even the beach is bustling, but it's really the cosmopolitan city that gets all the attention. Much of the activity revolves around Las Ramblas, a series of narrow streets and alleys packed with restaurants, nightclubs and a vibrant pedestrian market. But you should also take a tour of Antoni Gaud°'s masterpieces; Gaud° is responsible for sites like Casa MilÖ, Casa Batll¢ and La Sagrada Familia. You also shouldn't miss out on the eclectic shopping scene and the region's exquisite food and wine. You see why we suggest a week vacation? To get a lay of the land, consider signing up for one of the city's best guided tours.",https://travel.usnews.com/Barcelona_Spain/
Maldives,1676,"You've seen photos of the Maldives before: picture-perfect private villas suspended over striking blue waters, alabaster white sandˇbeachesˇand spectacular sunsets dipping into the horizon.

Banff,1445,"If you're itching to experience theˇlifestyle of a Swiss skiing village, but don't want to fork over the cash for a trans-Atlantic flight, consider Banff.ˇThanks to its location in the heart of the Canadian Rockiesˇnear the southeastern border of Banff National Parkˇ? Canada's first national parkˇ?ˇtaking trips here will decrease not only your flight time from the U.S. but also your expenses (although only marginally).ˇBanff caters to intrepid explorers who prefer to end the day in a niceˇhotelˇrather than roughing it at the campgrounds (though, there are plenty of those, too). Opportunities for adventure abound, so pick your sport: Ski downˇMount Norquay,ˇhikeˇto the massive, free-standing limestone pillars known as the Hoodoos, ""scramble"" up the face of the Stoney Squaw Mountain or bike along Healy Creek. When you are exhausted, retreat to your cozy (and warm)ˇresort, and replenish yourself with a hefty helping of bison meat.",https://travel.usnews.com/Banff_Canada/
New York City,1668,"Cool, cosmopolitan, crowded, constantly evolving ? the Big Apple blends big city splendor with small-town charm. Amid Gotham's iconic landmarks and towering skyscrapers, you'll experience a vibrant culture permeating each of the city's distinctive neighborhoods and boroughs.

Bali,444,"Shangri-La, Elysium, Arcadia, Utopia and Bali are all synonymous with ""heaven."" The only difference between them is that you can actually visit Bali. Many travelers have never been to this Indonesian island. Yet, the word ""Bali"" conjures daydreams of the most fantastical landscape: towering volcanoes wrapped in a deep green canopy, sandy shores that fade into turquoise waters and curving coastlines crowned with staggered pagodas. And believe it or not, Bali rarely disappoints.

You'll be amazed at how many different types of visitors revel in this paradise. The ordinary traveler simply stays at the palatial oceanfront resort and indulges in luxurious spa treatments, decadent cuisine and lazy sunbathing. But the historian will find his or her delights at the island's many temples while the adventurer will discover new paths up an active volcano in Kintamani. Plus, the town of Kuta boasts more riotous pleasures for those inclined to late nights. Bali is a dream come true, so wake up and book your ticket.",https://travel.usnews.com/Bali_Indonesia/
Sydney,982,"Sydney is both a laid-back beachside town and a thriving metropolis that boasts some of the Southern Hemisphere's best surf, landmarks and activities.

Dubai,1389,"Dubai is a city of superlatives, home to the world's tallest tower, one of the world's largest shopping malls, and one of the world's largest man-made marinas? but on a smaller scale, this emirate is still tied to its days as a modest port town. Traditional wooden abras (boats) float past motorboats on Dubai Creek, the natural sands of Jumeirah Public Beach fringe the carefully sculpted Palm Islands, and the bustling Gold and Spice Souks (marketplaces) thrive amid the larger-than-life Dubai Mall. Despite constantly looking to the future, this city isn't quick to let go of its past. It's this dynamic that not only put Dubai on the tourist map but will also keep it there.",https://travel.usnews.com/Dubai_United_Arab_Emirates/
St Lucia,1871,"Lush, unspoiled St. Lucia has a growing fan base. Some of its vacationers are music lovers, letting loose at the springtime St. Lucia Jazz & Arts Festival, or adrenaline junkies, testing their limits climbing The Pitons or zip lining through the Chassin region's rain forest.

Florence,918,"This little city, tucked amid the Tuscan hills, casts a long shadow through history. The wellspring of the Renaissance, Firenze (or Florence) sheltered the powerful Medici family and inspired artists like Michelangelo (David) and Brunelleschi (the Duomo). If it weren't for the fashionable Italians and chic shops lining Via Tornabuoni, you might think you had traveled back in time to the 14th century. But Renaissance art is not the only reason to come: You also visit Florence for its gorgeous sunsets, its Italian cooking and its romantic charm.

Santorini,3208,"Whatever remains of this mythological metropolis is now guarded by beautiful beaches and stately whitewashed homes. Today, Santorini consists of two inhabited islands and several islets.

San Francisco,1207,"A jumbled collage of colorful neighborhoods and beautiful views, San Francisco draws those free-spirited types who have an eye for edgy art, a taste for imaginative cuisine and a zeal for adventure. It's really not surprising that songwriter Tony Bennett left his heart here: The city boasts jaw-dropping sights, world-class cuisine, cozy cafes and plenty of booming nightlife venues ? there's no shortage of ways to stay busy here.

New Orleans,1336,"New Orleans is known for its European-style architecture, mouth-watering Creole cuisine and all-around good-time vibes. And as its backbone is music: Jazz, blues, rock 'n' roll and Zydeco tunes ooze from every city crevice. But for many, the main reason to visit is Mardi Gras, an over-the-top party with Carnival traits, such as masks, music, floats and merriment.

Plus, it's the perfect jumping off point for some of the best whale watching tours in Maine. Not only that, but the town fosters a special kind of charm that makes it feel as if you've stepped out of real life and walked into the pages of a storybook. Though, the abundance of finger-licking local lobster will certainly snap you back into reality in the best way possible.

Not only that, but the nearby Olympic Mountains and the giant Mount Rainier are visible from many spots in the city; ski slopes are just a short drive away.
